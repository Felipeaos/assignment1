</p> 
    Develop a software which can utilize Artificial Intelligence to automate financial transactions for managed funds. <br>
    There are a few companies who uses AI historical data to make decisions however there is a belief that with more information <br>
    the decisions taken can be more effective:

<ul>
    <li> economic climate</li>
    <li>Evaluate Political scenarios</li>
    <li>Monitor Social Media behaviours</li>
    <li>Live Database to analyse current stock levels and demand for Resources</li>
    <li>Logistical Data </li>
    <li>Historical Comparison</li>
    <li>Weather Forecast and Impacts on Resources</li>
    <li>Financial Strength of Organisations and Governments</li>
    <li>Risk Assessment of individual Profiles</li>
    <li>Operating in a variety of Markets with a higher diversity of cultures and languages</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Advantages</strong>
</p>
<p>

<ul>
    <li> Real Time Decisions maximizing returns. </li>
    <li>Efficacy in interpreting scenarios and efficiency in taking decisions.</li>
    <li> Utilize this information to match each individual investor' situation,<br>
        considering their level of savings, lifestyle, risk, potential to recover, <br>
        demographics and make decisions which will maximise gains whilst minimizing losses.</li>
    <li> This would remove the human and consequently the emotional level of decision. <br>
        As a consequence, the company utilizing such systems would have reduced overheads <br>
        being able to charge lower commission fees whilst operating with a higher profit margin.</li>
</ul>

</p>
    <strong>Risks</strong>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Artificial intelligence being misguided by fake news.</li>
    <li>Cyber attaks</li>
    <li>Loss of Control depending on how Artificial Intelligence develops</li>
    <li>Unemployment Increase for financial professionals</li>
</ul>

<p>The objective would be to create a tool which is web-based and easily accessed by anyone<br>
    with a computer who wants to invest in a higher range of portfolios without having to <br>
    take decisions and worrying about the risk. The intention to utilize AI is due to computers <br>
    have an infinite superiority to calculate numbers and probabilities compared to humans, also <br>
    the speed of the information received by the equipment would make a speedy decision on the <br>
    customerâ€™s behalf having an edge comparing to human decisions.</p>
