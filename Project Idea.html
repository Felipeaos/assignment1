    Develop a software which can utilize Artificial Intelligence to automate financial transactions for managed funds. There are a few companies who uses AI historical data to make decisions however there is a belief that with more information the decisions taken can be more effective:

<ul>
    <li><p> economic climate</li></p>
    <li><p>Evaluate Political scenarios</li></p>
    <li><p>Monitor Social Media behaviours</li></p>
    <li><p>Live Database to analyse current stock levels and demand for Resources</li></p>
    <p></p>Logistical Data </li></p>
    <li><p>Historical Comparison</li></p>
    <li><p>Weather Forecast and Impacts on Resources</li></p>
    <li><p>Financial Strength of Organisations and Governments</li></p>
    <li><p>Risk Assessment of individual Profiles</li></p>
    <li><p>Operating in a variety of Markets with a higher diversity of cultures and languages</li></p>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Advantages</strong>
</p>
<p>

<ul>
    <li><p> Real Time Decisions maximizing returns. </p></li>
    <li><p>Efficacy in interpreting scenarios and efficiency in taking decisions.</p></li>
    <li><p> Utilize this information to match each individual investor' situation, considering their level of savings, lifestyle, risk, potential to recover, demographics and make decisions which will maximise gains whilst minimizing losses.</p> 
    <li><p> This would remove the human and consequently the emotional level of decision. As a consequence, the company utilizing such systems would have reduced overheads being able to charge lower commission fees whilst operating with a higher profit margin.</p>
</ul>

</p>
    <strong>Risks</strong>
</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>Artificial intelligence being misguided by fake news.</p></li>
    <li><p>Cyber attaks</p></li>
    <li><p>Loss of Control depending on how Artificial Intelligence develops</p></li>
    <li><p>Unemployment Increase for financial professionals</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The objective would be to create a tool which is web-based and easily accessed by anyone with a computer who wants to invest in a higher range of portfolios without having to take decisions and worrying about the risk. The intention to utilize AI is due to computers have an infinite superiority to calculate numbers and probabilities compared to humans, also the speed of the information received by the equipment would make a speedy decision on the customerâ€™s behalf having an edge comparing to human decisions.</p>
