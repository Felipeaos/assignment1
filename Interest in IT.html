<strong><h1>My Interest in Information Technology</h1></strong>
<p></p>
<p>It is very widely accepted that Information Technology (IT) is present in most situations in our contemporary lives.<br>
<br>
Everywhere around us, an IT item is present. From mobile phones, Telecommunication towers, computers, GPS devices, <br>
 streaming services, smart televisions and home appliances, internet services, social media, distance education, etc.,<br>
 our modern lives are fully surrounded by technology.<br>

<p>My interest in IT started at a very young age playing video games, both on console and personal computers. During the <br>
 teenage years there was also a growing interest in online chats, peer to peer (P2P) software, web-based tools for school <br>
 research, travel planning, online banking, shopping, etc.<br>

Recently the interest in IT has been strengthening towards business tools such as website building (utilising templates from<br>
 web hosts), integration with different payments and booking systems, cloud accounting, performance, task tracking, GPS <br>
 applications, etc.<br>

In fact, year after year I have been spending more and more time working on a great number of systems which gives me a <br>
 high amount of satisfaction. The time increased and satisfaction generated by this has triggered a need to learn more about <br>
 Information Technology.</p>

<p>Running my service business and managing a small team whilst having a young family, an online course seemed like the best<br>
 solution in order to upgrade my skills, and the choice for RMIT was based on their reputation, experience in IT and flexibility.<br>
 My current interests are related to business software development and Artificial Intelligence. Further, I intend to seek work in <br>
 these fields however I am open to all the opportunities that may catch my interest along the course especially knowing that <br>
 Information Technology has a broad range of opportunities in areas that do not even exist at this moment.</p>
