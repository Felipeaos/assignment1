<p><strong><h3>My Interest in Information Technology</h3></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is widely acceptable that Information Technology (IT) is present in most situations in our comtemporary lives.</p>
<p>Everywhere around us, an IT item is present. From mobile phones, Telecommunication towers, computers, GPS devices, streaming services, smart televisions and home appliances, internet services, social media, distance education etc., our modern lives are fully sourrounded by technology.</p>
<p>My interest in IT started at a very young age playing video games, both on console and personal computers. During the teenage years there was also a growing interest in online chats, peer to peer (P2P) softwares, web based tools for school research, travel planning, online banking, shopping, etc.</p>
<p>Recently the interest in IT has been strenghening towards business tools such as website building (utilising templates from web hosts), integration with different payments and booking systems, cloud accounting, performance and task tracking, gps applications etc.</p>
<p>In fact, year after year I have been spending more and more time working on a great number of systems which gives me a high amount of satisfaction. The time increased and a satisfaction generated by this have triggered a need to learn more about Information Technology.</p>
<p>Running my service business and managing a small team whilst having a young family, an online course seemed like the best solution in order to upgrade my skills and the choice for RMIT was based on their reputation, experience in IT and flexibility. My current interests are related to business software development and Artificial Intelligence. Further I intend to seek work in these fields however I am open for all the oportunities that may catch my interest along the course specially knowing that Information Technology has a broad range of opportunities in areas that do not even exist at this moment.</p>
