<p>The results of the tests taken were surprisingly accurate. I am an introvert who gets along really well with everyone. I tend to get bored doing the same thing for too long and I love a challenge and change os scenario.<br>
    Running my own services business it shows how I give freedom to people in order to execute their jobs and I am more focused on the results.<br>
    Regarding working in a team, I am not usually the most talkative however and tend not to take problems personally and overall this has worked well in the past.</p>

   <p>I was born in Brazil and live in Perth WA, GMT/UTC +8 and I am currently enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming as core units to the Bachelor of Information Technology. Since early days I used to take computers apart and install software/hardware, etc., for family and friends as a hobby which I really enjoyed but since I got into the Macs &amp; iPhones, I have not done many exciting things in this regard. I have a Bachelor in International Relations and, until 2013, I worked with International Trade and logistics. Back then I helped my wife starting a commercial cleaning business and been running it ever since</p>
<p>In our own business, I try to always to include technology to make our lives easier and to be able to have a better overview of what is happening and to clearly see where we can improve. I am interested in metrics, geo-fencing, GPS tracking, communication with team members and customers, plus I love using cloud-based applications (I am terrible with paper). My experience is relatively superficial in the field of IT, mostly self-taught and have done a few different things from building basic websites, setting up payment gateways and integration between services, sites for online sales and our accounting software and more. I understand that there is a whole incredible hidden world out there to be explored! Additionally, one of the reasons I want to do this course is because it is a field that is borderless, used everywhere in the world, regardless of the location you acquired your knowledge. Which particular area of IT am I interested? Not quite sure yet, I am keen to learn and see what catches my interest, but I would believe to be something related to software development, cybersecurity or data management</p>
<p>My hobbies and interests vary from camping, 4x4, travelling and learning about different places and cultures, languages, watching tv series such as NetFlix, stan, amazon prime and so on.</p>
