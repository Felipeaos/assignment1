<p>The results of the tests taken were surprisingly accurate. I am an introvert who gets along really well with everyone. I tend to get bored doing the same thing for too long and I love a challenge and change os scenario.<br>
    Running my own services business it shows how I give freedom to people in order to execute their jobs and I am more focused on the results.<br>
    Regarding working in a team, I am not usually the most talkative however and tend not to take problems personally and overall this has worked well in the past.</p>

   <p>I was born in Brazil and live in Perth WA, GMT/UTC +8 and I am currently enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming as core units to the Bachelor of Information Technology. Since early days I used to take computers apart and install software/hardware, etc., for family and friends as a hobby which I really enjoyed but since I got into the Macs &amp; iPhones, I have not done many exciting things in this regard. I have a Bachelor in International Relations and, until 2013, I worked with International Trade and logistics. Back then I helped my wife starting a commercial cleaning business and been running it ever since</p>
<p>In our own business, I try to always to include technology to make our lives easier and to be able to have a better overview of what is happening and to clearly see where we can improve. I am interested in metrics, geo-fencing, GPS tracking, communication with team members and customers, plus I love using cloud-based applications (I am terrible with paper). My experience is relatively superficial in the field of IT, mostly self-taught and have done a few different things from building basic websites, setting up payment gateways and integration between services, sites for online sales and our accounting software and more. I understand that there is a whole incredible hidden world out there to be explored! Additionally, one of the reasons I want to do this course is because it is a field that is borderless, used everywhere in the world, regardless of the location you acquired your knowledge. Which particular area of IT am I interested? Not quite sure yet, I am keen to learn and see what catches my interest, but I would believe to be something related to software development, cybersecurity or data management</p>
<p>My hobbies and interests vary from camping with my family, 4x4, travelling and learning about different places and cultures, languages, watching tv series such as NetFlix, stan, amazon prime and so on.</p>
